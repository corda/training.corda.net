## Build the nodes

In the previous chapter, you looked at the example Cordapp code, here you are going to run it and get a feel of what is going on. You are going to run it all on your computer, in what can be described as a development network.

Running the project in a test and development context is a 3 step process. You will:

1. Declare the configuration.
2. Create the nodes' configuration files.
3. Launch the executables.

Here is a screencast of what comes ahead. You can always come back to it when you hit difficulties doing it on your own.

`vimeo: 417639538`

### Declare the configuration

The configuration is already declared with the help of [`deployNodes`](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/blob/a61e2cc9910d7d5de83122bf7d36fd071796a7c3/Basic/cordapp-example/workflows-java/build.gradle#L70-L114). Each `node` task statically declares a new node and its configuration. Together, these nodes represent a small, though whole, network, complete with a notary. Indeed, however small, a network needs a network map service to help each node connect to the other nodes it will interact with. The `deployNodes` task, among other things, distributes the network information on all declared nodes.

Since all nodes will run on a single machine, all ports need to be unique and assigned. If you did not assign ports, the nodes would all use the [default of 10002](https://github.com/corda/corda-gradle-plugins/blob/a0329ce4532f4cedfd34f9e6862bc8386ab0b76a/cordformation/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/plugins/Node.kt#L59) and that would create a port conflict on a single machine. The p2p address is not mentioned so it will default to [`localhost`](https://github.com/corda/corda-gradle-plugins/blob/a0329ce4532f4cedfd34f9e6862bc8386ab0b76a/cordformation/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/plugins/Node.kt#L27). Now, if you wanted to run your services on different machines, you would update the configuration with externally resolvable names or IPs under the label [`p2pAddress:`](https://github.com/corda/corda-gradle-plugins/blob/a0329ce4532f4cedfd34f9e6862bc8386ab0b76a/cordformation/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/plugins/Node.kt#L112), like so `p2pAddress "192.168.0.15:10006"`.

### Build the configuration files

Be sure you are in your `cordapp-example` working directory. Let us run this build task with:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```shell
$ ./gradlew deployNodes
```

```powershell
C:\cordapp-example> gradlew deployNodes
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

as [explained](https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#building-the-example-cordapp) by the Corda team.

#### Did you get this error?

    ```
     INFO Cannot initialize scripting support because this JRE does not support it. java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/script/ScriptEngineManager
    ```
    If yes, look back at the "Prepare your computer" chapter, and look for the part where running Gradle with a `JAVA_HOME` is described. It differs from your default configuration. That may mean running something like:

    ```shell
    $ ./gradlew -Dorg.gradle.java.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_191.jdk/Contents/Home deployNodes
    ```

</ExpansionPanelListItem>
<ExpansionPanelListItem number="2">

#### Or this one

`Build failed with an exception.` caused by: `error: package com.google.common.collect does not exist`.

To resolve that, open `IOUState.java` and:

- Remove this import: `import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;` near line 5.
- Modify `ImmutableList.of(new IOUSchemaV1())` to `Arrays.asList(new IOUSchemaV1())` near line 65.

Also open, `IOUSchemaV1.java` and:

- Remove this import: `import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;` near line 3.
- Modify `ImmutableList.of(PersistentIOU.class)` to `Arrays.asList(PersistentIOU.class)` ner line 17.

This task takes a long time, so this is a good time to refill your cup. Not only does the task take time on its own, but you are running 2 of them - one for `workflows-java` and the other for `workflows-kotlin`.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

In the future, to save time, run only the task for `workflows-java`, like so:

```shell
$ ./gradlew --build-file workflows-java/build.gradle deployNodes
```

</HighlightBox>

With the nodes built, as seen in `./workflows-java/build/nodes`. Inside this folder you will find the different nodes and their `node.conf` files, with their expected parameters. Also, helpfully, certificates have been created.

### Run the nodes

Now that your nodes have been deployed, do as per what the [documentation says](https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#id1) and run this command:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```shell
$ ./workflows-java/build/nodes/runnodes
```

```powershell
C:\cordapp-example> workflows-java\build\nodes\runnodes
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

You should get 4 pop-up windows; do not move focus away from them until all 4 show the welcome message:

```shell

Notice:

* The `Node for "Notary"` mention.
* The [quips data bank](https://github.com/corda/corda/blob/67e3e09a4edb41d17b8adfa669d671c690c5db33/node/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/node/internal/NodeStartup.kt#L362).

## Interact with the nodes

You are going to create your first IOU where PartyB owes 50 to PartyA. Because of how the flows are coded:

1. You need to initiate the flow from the lender, i.e. PartyA.
2. PartyB will receive it.
3. PartyC will be oblivious.

To show points 2 and 3, let's prepare PartyB and PartyC with an `IOUState` tracker. On the interactive shells of both nodes of `PartyB` and `PartyC`, run:

```shell
>>> run vaultTrack contractStateType: com.example.state.IOUState
Snapshot:
states: []
statesMetadata: []
totalStatesAvailable: -1
stateTypes: "UNCONSUMED"
otherResults: []

Updates:
Waiting for completion or Ctrl-C ...
```

<ExpansionPanel title="About this command">

This will watch `com.example.state.IOUState` for new states. Notice that the name of the state type to watch has to be the fully qualified name, so must include the package in which it is [declared](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/blob/a61e2cc9910d7d5de83122bf7d36fd071796a7c3/Basic/cordapp-example/contracts-java/src/main/java/com/example/state/IOUState.java#L1):

```java
package com.example.state;
```

</ExpansionPanel>

Then head to the interactive shell of PartyA and launch the `flow` as per [the docs](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/tutorial-cordapp.html#creating-an-iou-via-the-interactive-shell):

```shell
# In PartyA
>>> flow start ExampleFlow$Initiator iouValue: 50, otherParty: "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
```

<ExpansionPanel title="About this command">

So, Party A will start (with `Initiator`) the `ExampleFlow` with the other party, Party B. In case `O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US` is unclear, that is PartyB's `name`, which you can find in [`workflows-java/build.gradle`](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/blob/a61e2cc9910d7d5de83122bf7d36fd071796a7c3/Basic/cordapp-example/workflows-java/build.gradle#L97). As a reminder, the network topology, members and certificates were set up by `./gradlew deployNodes`. A production network uses a Network Map Service for name resolution and finding nodes, and a Doorman Service to manage admission.

</ExpansionPanel>

It takes a few seconds because the processes are started lazily. Notice the last line, that looks like:

```
Flow completed with result: SignedTransaction(id=EC06EA903314BE02610032933FBA2392151732CFD87408A4681C3AFEA83C53B1)
```
Head over to PartyC and see that the tracker has not seen anything, but on PartyB, you should see something like:

```
Observation 1: consumed: []
produced:
- state:
    data: !<com.example.state.IOUState>
      value: 50
      lender: "O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB"
      borrower: "O=PartyB, L=New York, C=US"
      linearId:
        externalId: null
        id: "0c0dd4e2-dc4e-4810-aa59-97f6bbe69567"
    contract: "com.example.contract.IOUContract"
    notary: "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB"
    encumbrance: null
    constraint: !<net.corda.core.contracts.SignatureAttachmentConstraint>
      key: "aSq9DsNNvGhYxYyqA9wd2eduEAZ5AXWgJTbTEw3G5d2maAq8vtLE4kZHgCs5jcB1N31cx1hpsLeqG2ngSysVHqcXhbNts6SkRWDaV7xNcr6MtcbufGUchxredBb6"
  ref:
    txhash: "EC06EA903314BE02610032933FBA2392151732CFD87408A4681C3AFEA83C53B1"
    index: 0
flowId: null
type: "GENERAL"
references: []
```
Nice, it worked as expected:

* Nothing was consumed: `Observation 1: consumed: []`.
* A single state was created, or `produced`, with the expected values. This concludes your first interaction with a flow from the command line.

In the next chapter, you will do the same but look deeper into the database.
