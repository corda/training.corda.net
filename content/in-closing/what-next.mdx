## In closing

Congratulations! You have come a long way. Starting with an introduction to distributed ledger technology (DLT), you have created your first CorDapp and added sophistication through a series of improvements. Your CorDapp encapsulates working examples of the techniques you will use to create enterprise applications with Corda.

## What's next?

You are probably keen to get started. Check out Spring webserver and Testnet, and check back here for another chapter (coming soon!) on tools and skills for development, deployment and production operations.

- [Spring webserver](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Basic/spring-webserver)
- [Corda flavored Ganache](https://blog.b9lab.com/cordacon-2019-highlights-truffles-corda-flavored-ganache-b83bf00f7c29)
- [Corda Testnet](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/corda-testnet-intro.html)

## Spread the word

Please spread the word and recommend this training to everyone who is interested in getting into Corda. Remember, it’s not just for coders. Non-technical students will appreciate the theory and proceed into depth that is appropriate for them. There is no need to complete the exercises to acquire a clear understanding of what Corda does and how it does it.

Don't forget. The training is offered with instructor support.
