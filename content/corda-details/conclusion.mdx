Congratulations on making it this far and on learning so much, not that this is all there is to Corda... In this module you learned about:

* How attachments work, and in what situations you can harness them.
* How reference states improve the reliability of information on some transactions, and how you can use them to implement expressive processes.
* How time is treated in Corda and how you can use that.
* What are services, and how easy it is to create your own little instance.
* How oracles are implementable in a safe manner and can be used to improve your business process.
