## Welcome to the Corda Training!

Corda is an open source blockchain platform to solve complex business problems.

Permissionless blockchain platforms, in which all data is shared with all parties, are largely unsuited for businesses. Corda was designed to only share data with relevant parties. Corda is flexible and scalable and ensures a high level of privacy and security.

Distributed Ledger applications on a high performance, enterprise grade platform. That is Corda.

- skillfully execute, producing code that showcases your understanding of best practices and knowledge of the SDK

## Who should follow this training

- Enterprise developers
- Consultants and freelancers
- Startup founders and CEOs
- Enthusiasts

## What’s inside

The course provides theoretical material and a lot of hands-on experience.

### First, a little theory.

- Blockchains, distributed ledgers and Corda’s unique design
- The Corda value proposition and use-cases

### Then, hands-on practice

- Up and running with an example CorDapp
- Your first CorDapp
- Deep dive, advanced techniques and best practice

## How to use this training

If you are new to blockchains and distributed ledgers, start with the [fundamentals](./fundamentals/introduction/) module. This brief overview of the universe of distributed application platforms provides background information that will help you appreciate Corda's unique approach. Carry on to [Key Concepts](./key-concepts/introduction/) to discover Corda's unique approach to distributed applications for enterprise settings.

As you work your way through the exercises you will construct a realistic CorDapp with incrementally increasing sophistication as you learn. When you are invited to work on your own, a solution is provided in the next section. Look for the expandable `Code` panels that present links to the code. Advanced users who want to skip over early sections can jump in later by using using the solution example of the previous exercise.
