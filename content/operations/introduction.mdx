In the previous modules you learned how to create a CorDapp. You learned how to unit test it and interact with it from your own node's shell.

The next step in your prototype's lifecycle is usually to deploy it on a testnet so you can show it to others. This is a step closer to production deployment and closely emulates the process. In this respect, it is a step closer to the real thing. 

So, how do you deploy your CorDapp on persistent machines and have them interact via a _real_ network? That's the purpose of this module.

This is not a comprehensive exploration of node administration. The goal is to help you, the developer, migrate your working code from your own machine to a testnet that is accessible from other nodes anywhere in the world.
